# hello-world
My first repository

I'm 22 years old and I'm currently studying Informatics (UCLA) in Venezuela.

I enjoy programming and i would like to specialze on web development, javascript is my favorite language however i attempt to get as involved as possible to other languages to expand my work area.

I like writting, music and i'm also a big fan of movies (with a bit of strange taste for them).
